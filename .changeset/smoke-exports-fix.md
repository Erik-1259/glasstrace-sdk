Add `./package.json` to both packages' `exports` maps so tooling and smoke tests can read installed versions via `require('@glasstrace/<pkg>/package.json')` without hitting `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` on Node 22+. Also fixes the post-publish smoke workflow to read `node_modules/@glasstrace/<pkg>/package.json` via `fs.readFileSync` so it works against already-published versions that do NOT have `./package.json` in their exports map.
